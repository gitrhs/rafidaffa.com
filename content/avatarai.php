        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            A system for real-time video conversations in
            Bahasa Indonesia. It combines natural language
            processing with a deepfake avatar to simulate
            face-to-face interaction. Users ask questions
            verbally, the system processes and retrieves the
            most relevant answers, then responds through a
            humanlike avatar with synchronized speech,
            mimicking the experience of talking with a real
            person.
        </div>
        <br />
        <h3>How it works? (the pipeline)</h3>
        <img src="image/avatarAI/avatarAI-flow-Fixed.png" class="blog-img" />
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            The process starts when a user asks a question
            verbally. The audio is transcribed into text,
            which is then converted into vector embeddings
            to capture its meaning. These embeddings are
            searched against a vector database, and the top
            three most relevant answers are returned.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            A large language model refines these answers
            into a coherent script. The script is converted
            into audio, which is then paired with a deepfake
            avatar to produce synchronized video
            outputâ€”delivering the response as if spoken by a
            real person in a live conversation.
        </div>
        <br />
        <h3>Video Demonstration</h3>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQmri8_rshg" class="projectimg" style="aspect-ratio: 560/315"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            For the demo, the system was configured to
            provide information about
            <a href="https://mandirisekuritas.co.id" target="_blank">Mandiri Sekuritas</a>. The model processes spoken
            questions and
            generates responses by the avatar in real-time.
        </div>
        <br />
        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            <b>Government and Public Information</b><br />
            AvatarAI can be applied to public communication
            where visuals are more effective than plain text
            or audio. A humanlike avatar delivering official
            announcements, policy updates, or service
            instructions helps audiences understand complex
            information more clearly. This approach can make
            government communication more engaging,
            accessible, and easier to follow for the general
            public.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            <b>Visual Interviews</b><br />
            The system can also be adapted for recruitment
            or training scenarios. Instead of static
            questionnaires or phone calls, candidates
            interact with a lifelike avatar that delivers
            questions and responds naturally. This creates a
            more realistic interview environment, helps
            standardize the process, and reduces the
            resources needed for repetitive interview
            stages.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            <b>Marketing, Sales, and Live-stream Commerce</b><br />
            In business, AvatarAI can support product
            demonstrations, promotions, or live-stream
            sales. An avatar presenting information in real
            time can engage audiences in a format similar to
            human hosts. This enables companies to scale
            outreach, maintain consistent messaging, and
            create interactive experiences that drive higher
            engagement and sales conversions.
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content-body">
            <b>Customer Service</b><br />
            AvatarAI can serve as a 24/7 front line for customer support. Instead of navigating text chatbots or long
            call queues, customers interact with a lifelike avatar that listens, processes questions, and responds in
            real time. This creates a more natural and efficient support experience, reduces wait times, and allows
            businesses to handle large volumes of inquiries consistently.
